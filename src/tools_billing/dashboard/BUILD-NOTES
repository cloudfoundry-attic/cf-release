Build with Maven 3.0.4 (http://mirror.lividpenguin.com/pub/apache/maven/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz):

    $ mvn package
    $ ls target/*.war
    target/dashboard-1.0-SNAPSHOT-xxxxx.war

Or run directly with

    $ mvn tomcat:run-war

The app will start at http://localhost:8080/dashboard.

Once you have built the war file, if you stop and want to start the
server again and haven't made any changes, you will find this useful:

    $ mvn tomcat:run-war -Dgwt.compiler.skip=true
